# Physics Calculator GUI

## Introduction  
Physics Calculator GUI is a Tkinter-based physics calculator that integrates common physics formulas and basic arithmetic calculations. Users can also **customize their own physics formulas** for personalized calculations.

## Features  
- **Mathematical Calculations**: Supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).  
- **Physics Formula Calculations**:
  - Einstein’s Mass-Energy Equation: E = mc²  
  - Weight Calculation: W = mg  
  - Newton’s Second Law: F = ma  
  - Density Calculation: P = m/v  
  - Gravitational Potential Energy: ΔE = mgΔh  
  - Work Calculation: ΔW = FΔS  
  - Power Calculation: P = W/t  
  - Wave Speed Calculation: V = fλ  
- **Custom Formula Support**:
  - Users can define their own physics formulas and use them in calculations.  
- **Toggle Mode**:
  - Click the **"Phy"** button to expand/collapse the physics formula panel.
